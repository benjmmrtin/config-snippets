## Running `kprobe`
_The following assumes that the KProbe host agent is installed and available on the server._

>**kprobe needs Root privileges to run.**
Please run one instance of kprobe per interface on the server.
If not specified in the command line, sample rate will use the one configured in the left-side portal form.
Instead of displaying the API Token in the command line below, KProbe will try and read the `KENTIK_API_TOKEN` environment variable if it is set on the server.

Run the following command to start `kprobe` on the server:
```
/usr/local/bin/kprobe --email {{current_user_email}} \
  --token {{current_user_api_token}} \
  --interface <interface_name e.g. eth0> \
  --device-name {{curr_device_name}} \
  --device-plan {{selected_plan}} \
  --sample {{configured_sample_rate}}
```

#### Optional parameters
These should be appended to the command line displayed above, remember to add a `\` at the end of each line for a multi-line command.

- **`--proxy-url http://<http_proxy_or_kproxy_IP>:<proxy-port>`**: If "Sends Flow through kProxy" is enabled.
- **`--no-decodes`**: If additional decodes are _disabled_.
- **`--http-port <one_port_per_HTTP_port_to_decode>`**: If additional decodes are _enabled_.
